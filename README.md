## Summary

Condensation is a [gulp](http://gulpjs.com) task generator that helps
compile, package and upload [Handlebars.js](http://http://handlebarsjs.com/)
templates with static assets for use with AWS CloudFormation.

## Why?

CloudFormation templates are great for creating, updating and deleting
AWS resources.  Reusing parts of templates, referencing other
templates with `AWS::CloudFormation::Stack` and deploying cloud-init
scripts can be difficult.

* It is often the case that the same AMIs are used in
[Mappings](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSCloudFormation/latest/UserGuide/mappings-section-structure.html)
over and over again.
* It is common to set up a VPC with nearly
identical attributes and structure for different applications and
services.
* To bootstrap instances it is nice to have scripts and configuration
  files deployed in a known location and verisoned with the template
they are associated with.

Condensation's goal is to make deploying and reusing CloudFormation
definitions easy.

The first use case replaced `{{s3.awsPath}}` for a `AWS::CloudFormation::Stack`
`TemplateURL` key.  This allowed for self referencing
urls for a deploy.  Many small stacks could be deployed to a bucket
where each stack could reference the other.  That pattern could then be
repeated for multiple development and production buckets.

Example:

    "TemplateURL": "{{s3.awsPath}}/infra_core/vpc.template"
    ...
    "TemplateURL": "{{s3.awsPath}}/infra_core/subnet.template"

Deployed as:

    https://s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/MYBUCKETv1/infra_core/vpc.template
    https://s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/MYBUCKETv1/infra_core/subnet.template

And then as:

    https://s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/MYBUCKETv2/infra_core/vpc.template
    https://s3-us-east-1.amazonaws.com/MYEASTBUCKETv2/infra_core/subnet.template

The URL will always reference other templates deployed within the same
bucket.

Options have now been added to use partials and deploy assets (scripts, configurations)
alongside templates.


## Use

### Create a project

    > npm init

#### Install [gulp](http://gulpjs.com/)

    > npm install -g gulp
    > npm install gulp --save

#### Install [bower](http://bower.io)

    > npm install -g bower

#### Install condensation

    > npm install condensation --save

#### Add condensation to gulpfile.js

    var gulp = require('gulp');

    var config = {
      s3: [
        {
          aws: {
            region: 'us-east-1',
            bucket: 'MY-FAVORITE-BUCKET',
          },
          validate: false,
          create: true
        }
      ],
      src: './',
      dependencySrc: [
        'bower_components'
      ],
      dist: 'dist',
    };

    // Will add necessary gulp tasks to build, compile and validate
    // CloudFormation templates
    require('condensation').buildTasks(gulp,config);

### Project Structure

    particles
     |
     -- assets
     |
     -- cftemplates
     |
     -- partials

Condensation will look for `assets`, `cftemplates` and `partials` under
the `particles` directory.

#### assets

Files to be uploaded to S3 that are used to supplement CloudFormation
templates.  Files can include boostrap scripts, packaged install files
or configuration files.

Any file with a `.hbs` extension will be
compiled with handlebars and saved to S3 without the `.hbs` extension.

#### cftemplates

CloudFormation templates that will be uploaded to S3.

Any file with a `.hbs` extension will be compiled with
handlebars and saved to S3 without the `.hbs` extension.

#### partials

Contents of files here will be loaded as partials that can be used in
`assets` and `cftemplates`.

These files will not be packaged or uploaded to S3.

### Tasks

Get a full list of tasks by running `gulp -T`

By default all tasks are prefixed with `condensation:`. This can be
changed with the `taskPrefix` config option.

#### Default

The `default` task is an alias for `build`. It will prepare all files
for deployment to s3. Templates and assets are written to the configured
`dist` directory.

    > gulp condensation:default


#### s3:list
Will list all the configured s3 bukets and their corresponding ID.

    > gulp condensation:s3:list
    [10:21:47] Using gulpfile ~/condensation-example/gulpfile.js
    [10:21:47] Starting 'condensation:s3:list'...
    0: a.bucket.in.us-east-1
    1: a.bucket.in.us-west-2
    [10:21:47] Finished 'condensation:s3:list' after 153 Î¼s

The IDs can be used to deploy to a single bucket instead of all buckets.

#### deploy
For the `deploy` task to run AWS credentials must be set as environment
variables: `AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY` and `AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID`

    > AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY=XXXX AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID=XXXX gulp deploy

This will upload templates to all cofigured S3 buckets.

#### condensation:deploy:<ID>
Deploy tempates to a specific S3 bucket.


## Config Options

Add any local configuration overrides to `config/local.js`. This file
is ignored by git and is applied after `config/default.js`.  See
`config/default.js` for options.

    var config = {
      // Array of S3 buckets to deploy to
      s3: [
        {
          // AWS specific options
          aws: {
            region: 'us-east-1',
            bucket: 'my.bucket.in.us-east-1',
          },

          // Run CloudFormation validation before deploying this bucket
          validate: false,

          // Create this bucket if it does not already exist
          create: true
        },
      ],
      // The prefix to add to all generated gulp tasks (default: 'condensation')
      // An empty string will remove the prefix
      //     - condensation:deploy will become deploy
      taskPrefix: '',

      // Directory that contains the `particles` directory.
      root: './',

      // Location of dependency packages
      dependencySrc: [
        'bower_components'
      ],
      dist: 'dist',
    };

## Bower

Bower is used for dependency management to facilitate the sharing and
reuse of assets, cftemplates and partials of other projects.


## TODO
* Add labels to S3 configuration.
  * Allow deploy for labels
* Optons Delete previous S3 objects and/or bucket
* Replace console.log with native gulp info and warnings
* Fix ensure bucket to work with cross account access.
  * add option to ignore errors here?
