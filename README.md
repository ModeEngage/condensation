## Summary

Condensation is a [gulp](http://gulpjs.com) task generator that helps
compile, package and upload [AWS CloudFormation](http://aws.amazon.com/cloudformation/)
templates and supporting assets.

Any file with the extension `.hbs` will be compiled with
[Handlebars.js](http://http://handlebarsjs.com/) to support
partials and variable replacement.

## Features

* Write reusable CloudFormation snippits that can be included as
  partials
* Package and upload templates and assets to multiple buckets across
  regions with one command.
* References other templates within the same package with
  [AWS::CloudFormation::Stack](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSCloudFormation/latest/UserGuide/aws-properties-stack.html)
and `{{s3.awsPath}}`
* Upload scripts, configuration files and other assets alongside
  CloudFormation templates.

## Why?

CloudFormation templates are great for creating, updating and deleting
AWS resources.  Reusing parts of templates, referencing other
templates with `AWS::CloudFormation::Stack` and deploying cloud-init
scripts can be difficult to manage.

* Often sections such as AMI [mappings](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSCloudFormation/latest/UserGuide/mappings-section-structure.html)
  are re-used by many templates.  Handlebars partials provide a way to
  write the mapping once and reuse it without copying from template to
  template.
* It is common to set up resources, such as a VPC, with nearly
  identical attributes and structure for different applications and
  services.  Condensation allows that definition to become a independent
  stack that can be referenced by other templates that are part of the
  same package.
* To bootstrap instances it is beneficial to have scripts and configuration
  files deployed in a known location and verisoned with the template
  they are associated with.
* When using `AWS::CloudFormation::Authentication` to download assets from
  S3 buckets all resources must be in the same region.  Condensation
  makes it easy to deploy the same templates and assets to multiple
  regions and ensure the referencing URLs are correct.
* With the help of bower, condensation makes it possible to share partials,
  templates and assets with other projects.

The first use case replaced `{{s3.awsPath}}` within a `AWS::CloudFormation::Stack`
`TemplateURL` value.  This allowed for self referencing
urls for a package.

Now stacks (templates) can be deployed to a bucket
where each stack can reference one another.  That pattern can
repeated using difference confgurations for the same templates
to support development, production and multi-region buckets.

Example:

    "TemplateURL": "{{s3.awsPath}}/infra_core/vpc.template"
    ...
    "TemplateURL": "{{s3.awsPath}}/infra_core/subnet.template"

Deployed as:

    https://s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/MYBUCKETv1/infra_core/vpc.template
    https://s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/MYBUCKETv1/infra_core/subnet.template

And then as:

    https://s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/MYBUCKETv2/infra_core/vpc.template
    https://s3-us-east-1.amazonaws.com/MYEASTBUCKETv2/infra_core/subnet.template

With the help of Handlebars the URL will always reference the template deployed within the same
bucket.


## Use

Take a look at
[condensation-examples](https://github.com/kmcgrath/condensation-examples)
for a quick start.

### Create a project

    > npm init

#### Install [gulp](http://gulpjs.com/)

    > npm install -g gulp
    > npm install gulp --save

#### Install [bower](http://bower.io)

    > npm install -g bower

#### Install condensation

    > npm install condensation --save

#### Add condensation to gulpfile.js

    var gulp = require('gulp');

    var config = {
      s3: [
        {
          aws: {
            region: 'us-east-1',
            bucket: 'MY-FAVORITE-BUCKET',
          },
          validate: false,
          create: true
        }
      ],
      src: './',
      dependencySrc: [
        'bower_components'
      ],
      dist: 'dist',
    };

    // Will add necessary gulp tasks to build, compile and validate
    // CloudFormation templates
    require('condensation').buildTasks(gulp,config);

### Project Structure

    my-project
    |
    -- bower.json
    |
    -- guplfile.js
    |
    -- README.md
    |
    --particles
      |
      --assets
      |
      -- cftemplates
      |
      -- partials

Condensation will look for `assets`, `cftemplates` and `partials` under
the `particles` directory.

#### assets

Files to be uploaded to S3 that are used to supplement CloudFormation
templates.  Files can include boostrap scripts, packaged install files
or configuration files.

Any file with a `.hbs` extension will be
compiled with handlebars and saved to S3 without the `.hbs` extension.

#### cftemplates

CloudFormation templates that will be uploaded to S3.

Any file with a `.hbs` extension will be compiled with
handlebars and saved to S3 without the `.hbs` extension.

#### partials

Contents of files here will be loaded as partials that can be used in
`assets` and `cftemplates`.

These files will not be packaged or uploaded to S3.

### Tasks

Get a full list of tasks by running `gulp -T`

By default all tasks are prefixed with `condensation:`. This can be
changed with the `taskPrefix` config option.

#### Default

The `default` task is an alias for `build`. It will prepare all files
for deployment to s3. Templates and assets are written to the configured
`dist` directory.

    > gulp condensation:default


#### condensation:s3:list
Will list all the configured s3 bukets and their corresponding ID.

    > gulp condensation:s3:list
    [10:21:47] Using gulpfile ~/condensation-example/gulpfile.js
    [10:21:47] Starting 'condensation:s3:list'...
    0: a.bucket.in.us-east-1
    1: a.bucket.in.us-west-2
    [10:21:47] Finished 'condensation:s3:list' after 153 Î¼s

The IDs can be used to deploy to a single bucket instead of all buckets.

#### deploy
For the `deploy` task to run AWS credentials must be set as environment
variables: `AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY` and `AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID`

    > AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY=XXXX AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID=XXXX gulp deploy

This will upload templates to all cofigured S3 buckets.

#### condensation:deploy:<ID>
Deploy tempates to a specific S3 bucket.


## Config Options

Add any local configuration overrides to `config/local.js`. This file
is ignored by git and is applied after `config/default.js`.  See
`config/default.js` for options.

    var config = {
      // Array of S3 buckets to deploy to
      s3: [
        {
          // AWS specific options
          aws: {
            region: 'us-east-1',
            bucket: 'my.bucket.in.us-east-1',
          },

          // Run CloudFormation validation during the build task for this bucket
          validate: true,

          // Create this bucket if it does not already exist
          create: true

          // Prefix all objects (allows for multiple deploymets to the same bucket
          prefix: ''
        },
      ],
      // The prefix to add to all generated gulp tasks (default: 'condensation')
      // An empty string will remove the prefix
      //     - condensation:deploy will become deploy
      taskPrefix: '',

      // Directory that contains the `particles` directory.
      // Used for test scripts, should not be changed if sharing templates
      root: './',

      // Location of dependency packages
      dependencySrc: [
        'bower_components'
      ],

      // Where the build task will put the distribution
      dist: 'dist',
    };

## Bower

Bower is used for dependency management to facilitate the sharing and
reuse of assets, cftemplates and partials of other projects.


## TODO
* Add labels to S3 configuration.
  * Allow deploy for labels
* Optons Delete previous S3 objects and/or bucket
* Replace console.log with native gulp info and warnings
* Fix ensure bucket to work with cross account access.
  * add option to ignore errors here?
